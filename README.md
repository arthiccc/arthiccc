$ whoami
I am a self-driven Developer based in Earth. At 24, I decided to pivot away from formal academia to pursue a more hands-on, accelerated path in software development. 
I specialize in Javascripts and thrive in environments that value **output** and **problem-solving** over credentials.

$ to do
- Current Focus: Full-stack development and Open Source contribution.
- Philosophy: Continuous learning is a lifestyle, not a classroom requirement.
- Looking to collaborate on:** Anything that helps people.

$ status
Currently sleeping.
